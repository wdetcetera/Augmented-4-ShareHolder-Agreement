Allocation

If the aggregate Transfer Acceptances received by the Board in accordance with clause 10.2 is equal to or less than the total number of Sale Shares, each Accepting Shareholder’s allocation of Sale Shares (Allocation) is the amount of Shares set out in its Transfer Acceptance.

If the aggregate Transfer Acceptances received by the Board in accordance with clause 10.2 is greater than the total number of Sale Shares, each Accepting Shareholder’s Allocation will be determined as follows:

each Accepting Shareholder will be allocated the lesser of:

the number of Sale Shares set out in its Transfer Acceptance; and

the relevant Accepting Shareholder’s Respective Proportion of the Sale Shares; and

if any Sale Shares remain unallocated, each Accepting Shareholder who, in their Transfer Acceptance specified a number of Sale Shares greater than the number of Sale Shares allocated to them, will be allocated additional Sale Shares in proportion to their Respective Proportion (provided that no Accepting Shareholder will be allocated more Sale Shares than the number set out in its Transfer Acceptance) and this process will be repeated until either all Sale Shares are allocated, or each Accepting Shareholder has been allocated the number of Sale Shares set out in its Transfer Acceptance.

Notice of Allocation

As soon as reasonably practicable and no later than 5 Business Days after the determination of each Accepting Shareholder's Allocation in accordance with clause 10.3, the Company must give each Accepting Shareholder a notice setting out its Allocation, and must provide the Seller with a copy of each such notice, within 5 Business Days.

the Company must immediately notify the Seller of the unallocated Sale Shares; and

the Seller is free to Dispose of the unallocated Sale Shares to any other party within 90 days of the date of the Transfer Notice on terms no more favourable to the other party than those set out in the Transfer Notice.

issue a new share certificate in the name of each Accepting Subscriber for its Allocation and, if applicable, a new share certificate in the name of the Seller in respect of any balance of Shares held.

If an Accepting Shareholder fails to complete the acquisition of its allocated Sale Shares in accordance with clause 10.6(a), those Sale Shares will be treated as unallocated Sale Shares and may be disposed of in accordance with clause 10.5.

Tag Along Option

If one or more Shareholders receive a bona fide offer from a proposed purchaser to purchase all or a proportion of their Shares representing in aggregate [25]% or more of the total issued Shares (on an As-Converted Basis), and those Shareholders wish to accept that offer (Tag Sellers), the Tag Sellers must, after complying with the pre-emption procedure set out in this clause 10, give each other Shareholder a notice (Tag Along Notice) of their intention.

the Company may, by written notice to the Founder Shareholder, buy back, or direct the Founder Shareholder to transfer to a person nominated by the Board (acting by Required Resolution), some or all of the Unvested Shares held by such Founder Shareholder for an aggregate price equal to $1.00 and the Founder Shareholder must do everything necessary to facilitate the sale of such Unvested Shares to the Company (or to the person nominated by the Board) within 5 Business Days of the Company's notice.

Any Unvested Shares in existence from time to time shall carry the same rights in all respects as fully vested Ordinary Shares, except as set out in this clause 12.

Despite anything else in this deed the pre-emption procedure set out in clause 10 does not apply to a buy back or transfer of Unvested Shares under clause 12.2(a).

Restriction

Despite clause 12.2, the Company may only buy back the Unvested Shares if that is permitted under Part 2J.1 of the Corporations Act and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the buyback will not materially prejudice the Company's ability to pay its creditors.

Bad leaver arrangements

Bad Leaver

In consideration of the payment of $1.00 by the Company to each Founder Shareholder, the Founder Shareholder agrees that if the Relevant Founder becomes a Bad Leaver, the Company may by written notice, buy back some or all of the Shares held by the Founder Shareholder (Default Shares) or direct the Founder Shareholder to transfer some or all of the Default Shares to a person nominated by the Board (acting by Required Resolution) at the price set out in clause 13.2. 

For the avoidance of any doubt, the Default Shares do not include any Unvested Shares, which will be dealt with in accordance with clause 12.2 of this deed. 

The Relevant Founder or any person appointed as a Director by the Founder Shareholder may not vote at a Board meeting in relation to the giving of a notice under clause 13.1(a), unless the Board unanimously determines otherwise.

If the Company notifies the Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) that it wishes to buy back or require a compulsory transfer of the Default Shares under clause 13.1(a), the Founder or Founder Entity (as applicable) and the other Shareholders must do everything necessary to facilitate the sale of the Default Shares to the Company or the Company’s nominee within 10 Business Days of the Company's notice. 

Despite clauses 13.1(a) and 13.1(c), the Company may only buy back the Default Shares if that is permitted under Part 2J.1 of the Corporations Act and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the buyback will not materially prejudice the Company's ability to pay its creditors.

Despite anything else in this deed the pre-emption procedure set out in clause 10 does not apply to a buy back or transfer of Default Shares under clause 13.1(a).

Price for Default Shares

The price for the Default Shares (Default Price) is [50]% of Fair Market Value.

Other remedies

The rights and remedies set out in this clause do not exclude any other rights or remedies that a party may have against a party in default of this deed.

Suspension

To the extent that the Law allows and unless the Board determines otherwise by Required Resolution, from the time of giving notice under clause 13.1:

the Relevant Founder and any other director appointed by the relevant Founder Shareholder is deemed to have provided a resignation notice to the Company at the same time as the Founder Shareholder is notified pursuant to clause 13.1 and is automatically removed from the Board at that time, and has no further right to participate in the Business or management of the Group; and

the rights of the Founder Shareholder as a holder of Default Shares and under this deed (including any rights to information about the Group or the business dividend and distribution rights in relation to the Default Shares, and the rights to attend and vote at general meetings of Shareholders, and any consent rights under this deed) are suspended until those Default Shares have been acquired by the Company or as directed by the Company; and

the obligations of the Founder Shareholder (and the Relevant Founder) under this deed will continue to bind the Founder Shareholder (and the Relevant Founder) notwithstanding the suspension.

The suspensions referred to in clause 13.4(a) will cease if the Board (acting by Required Resolution) so determines in its absolute discretion.

Fair Market Value 

The Board will determine by Required Resolution the Fair Market Value of the Default Shares and will notify the Founder Shareholder within 5 Business Days of such determination.

If the Board is unable to determine the Fair Market Value by Required Resolution, the Board must appoint an Independent Expert (acceptable to both the Board and the relevant Founder Shareholder) to determine the Fair Market Value in accordance with this clause. The Company is responsible for all costs associated with the appointment of an Independent Expert under this clause 13.5(b).  

If the Board determines the Fair Market Value in accordance with clause 13.5(a) and the Founder Shareholder disputes the Fair Market Value determined by the Board, the Board must at the request of the Founder Shareholder appoint an Independent Expert (acceptable to both the Board and the relevant Founder Shareholder) to determine the Fair Market Value in accordance with this clause 13.5. The Founder Shareholder is responsible for all costs associated with the appointment of an Independent Expert under this clause 13.5(c).

The Fair Market Value as certified by the Independent Expert will be binding except in the case of manifest error.

An Independent Expert appointed to calculate the Fair Market Value of the Default Shares under this clause:

will do so as an expert, not as an arbitrator; and

will calculate a separate value for each class of Default Shares.

Restraints

Enforceability and severance

This clause has effect as if it were separate and independent clauses, each one being severable from the others and consisting of the covenant set out in clause 14.2 combined with each separate period referred to in clause 14.3, and each combination combined with each separate area referred to in clause 14.4.

If any of these separate clauses are void, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it will be deemed to be severed to the extent that it is void or to the extent of voidability, invalidity or unenforceability and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other separate clause or other combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4.

Goods and Services Tax

Definitions

In this clause:

GST means "GST" as defined in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 as amended (GST Act) or any replacement or other relevant legislation and regulations;

words used in this clause which have a particular meaning in the GST law (as defined in the GST Act, and also including any applicable legislative determinations and Australian Taxation Office public rulings) have the same meaning, unless the context otherwise requires;

any reference to GST payable by a party includes any corresponding GST payable by the representative member of any GST group of which that party is a member; and

if the GST law treats part of a supply as a separate supply for the purpose of determining whether GST is payable on that part of the supply or for the purpose of determining the tax period to which that part of the supply is attributable, such part of the supply is to be treated as a separate supply.

General exclusion of GST

Unless GST is expressly included, the consideration expressed to be payable under any other clause of this deed for any supply made under or in connection with this deed does not include GST.

Gross-up of Taxable Supply

To the extent that any supply made under or in connection with this deed is a taxable supply, the GST exclusive consideration otherwise payable for that supply is increased by an amount equal to that consideration multiplied by the rate at which GST is imposed in respect of the supply, and is payable at the same time.

Further acts

Each party agrees to do all things, including providing tax invoices and other documentation, that may be necessary or desirable to enable or assist the other party to claim any input tax credit, adjustment or refund in relation to any amount of GST paid or payable in respect of any supply made under or in connection with this deed.

Reimbursement and indemnity

If a payment to a party under this deed is a payment by way of reimbursement or indemnity and is calculated by reference to the GST inclusive amount of a loss, cost or expense incurred by that party, then the payment is to be reduced by the amount of any input tax credit to which that party is entitled in respect of that loss, cost or expense before any adjustment is made for GST pursuant to clause 19.3.

Cumulative Rights

The rights and remedies in this deed are in addition to other rights and remedies given by Law independently of this deed.

No waiver

A failure, delay, relaxation or indulgence by a party in exercising any power or right conferred on the party by this deed does not operate as a waiver of the power or right.

A single or partial exercise of the power or right does not preclude a further exercise of it or the exercise of any other power or right under this deed.

Deed and Constitution

If there is an inconsistency between this deed and the Constitution, the provisions of this deed prevail.

If necessary, the Shareholders must procure that the Constitution (and the constitution of each Subsidiary) is amended as soon as is practicable to ensure that a provision of this deed is effective in accordance with its terms.

To the maximum extent permitted by Law, the parties agree to waive any provisions contained in the Constitution to the extent that those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions in this deed, so that they have no force or effect during the term of this deed.
