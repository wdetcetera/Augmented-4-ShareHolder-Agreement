\section{Payment of dividends by asset distribution}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Any general meeting determining or the directors deciding to pay a dividend may, by resolution, direct payment of the dividend wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets, including paid up shares in, or debentures of, the Company or any other body corporate, and the directors must give effect to that resolution.
    
    \item Where a difficulty arises in regard to a distribution of specific assets referred to in rule 130.a, the directors may resolve the difficulty as they see fit.
    
    \item The directors may:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item fix the value for distribution of the specific assets or any part of those assets;
        \item determine that cash payments will be made to any members on the basis of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all parties; and
        \item vest any of those specific assets in trustees,
    \end{enumerate}
    
    as the directors see fit.
\end{enumerate}
