\section{Waiver of notice}

All resolutions of the directors passed at a meeting where a quorum is present but where notice of meeting has not been given to each director, or any act carried out under any of the resolutions, is as valid as if notice of meeting had been given to all directors if each director to whom notice was not given subsequently agrees to waive the notice.
