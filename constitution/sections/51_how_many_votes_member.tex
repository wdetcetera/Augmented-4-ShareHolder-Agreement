\section{How many votes a member has}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any class of shares, at a meeting of members:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item on a show of hands, each member has one vote; and
        \item on a poll, each member has one vote for each share the member holds.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item The vote may be exercised in person, by proxy or body corporate representative.
    
    \item When a shareholder appoints two proxies the appointment must specify the proportion of the Member's voting rights which each proxy is entitled to represent.
    
    \item Where a person is entitled to vote in more than one capacity (representative or proxy) in respect of the same share, that person is only entitled to one vote.
    
    \item A member is not entitled to vote at a general meeting in respect of shares on which any calls or other sums presently payable are unpaid.
\end{enumerate}
