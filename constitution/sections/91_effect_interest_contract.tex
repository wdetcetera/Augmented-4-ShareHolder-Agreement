\section{Effect of interest in contract}

Subject to the Act, if a director has a material personal interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of the Company and:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item the director discloses the nature and extent of the interest and its relation to the affairs of the Company at a meeting of the directors; or
    
    \item the interest is one that does not need to be disclosed under the Act, then:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item the director may vote on matters that relate to the interest;
        \item any transactions that relate to the interest may proceed;
        \item the director may retain benefits under the transaction even though the director has the interest; and
        \item the Company cannot avoid the transaction merely because of the existence of the interest.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If disclosure is required under rule 90, rules 91.a.v and 91.a.vi apply only if the disclosure is made before the transaction is entered into.
