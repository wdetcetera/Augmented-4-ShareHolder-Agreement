\section{Registration of transfers - procedure}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A person transferring shares remains the holder of the shares until the transfer is registered and the name of the person to whom they are being transferred is entered in the Register in respect of the shares.
    
    \item Before a transfer of shares is registered:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item the transfer and any share certificate must be lodged at the Company's registered office or any other place the directors allow;
        \item any fee payable on registration of the transfer must be paid; and
        \item the directors must be given any further information they reasonably require to establish the right of the person transferring the shares to make the transfer.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item The directors must not register any transfer of shares unless that transfer is permitted under this constitution and the Shareholders Agreement.
    
    \item The directors may in their discretion dispense with any of the requirements of rule 21.b.
    
    \item The instrument of transfer must be executed by or on behalf of both the transferor and the transferee.
    
    \item All powers of attorney granted by members which may be used for the purpose of transferring shares and which are lodged, produced or exhibited to the Company must be treated as between the Company and the grantor of the powers as remaining in full force and may be acted upon until express notice in writing of their revocation or of the death of the grantor is lodged at the registered office of the Company.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} The directors' discretion under this section is subject to the mandatory transfer restrictions and procedures set out in the Shareholders Agreement. No transfer may be registered that violates the Shareholders Agreement provisions.
