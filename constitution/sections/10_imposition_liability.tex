    \item This rule 10 applies where any law for the time being of any country, state or place:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item imposes or purports to impose any immediate or future or possible liability upon the Company to make any payment in respect of a member; or
        \item empowers any government or taxing authority or government official to require the Company to make any payment in respect of a share registered in the Register as held either jointly or solely by a member or in respect of any dividend or other money which is or may become due or payable or is accruing due to the member by the Company on or in respect of the share;
    \end{enumerate}
    
    whether in consequence of:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \setcounter{enumii}{2}
        \item the death of the member;
        \item the liability of the member for income tax or other tax;
        \item the liability of the executor or administrator of the member or of the member's estate for any estate, probate, succession, death, stamp or other duty; or
        \item anything else.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item If any liability contemplated by rule 10.a is imposed on the Company, the Company:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item must be fully indemnified by the member or the member's executor or administrator from all liability;
        
        \item has a first and paramount lien upon all shares registered in the Register as held either jointly or solely by the member and upon all dividends and other money payable in respect of the shares for any liability arising under that law and for any amount paid in complete or partial satisfaction of the liability and for interest on any amount so paid at the rate per annum set by the directors from the date of payment to the date of repayment. The Company may deduct from or set off against the dividends or other money payable any money so paid or payable by the Company together with interest;
        
        \item may recover as a debt due from the member or the member's executor or administrator wherever situated any money paid by the Company under or in consequence of that law and interest on the money at the rate and for the period referred to in rule 10.b.ii in excess of any dividend or other money then due or payable by the Company to the member; and
        
        \item may, if the money is paid or payable by the Company under that law refuse to register a transfer of the shares by the member or the member's executor or administrator until the money with interest is set off or deducted or where that amount exceeds the amount of the dividend or other money then due or payable by the Company to the member, until the excess is paid to the Company.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item This rule 10 does not prejudice or affect any right or remedy which that law may confer or purport to confer on the Company and the right or remedy is enforceable by the Company against the member and the member's executors, administrators and estate wherever situated whether or not the right or remedy is validly conferred.
