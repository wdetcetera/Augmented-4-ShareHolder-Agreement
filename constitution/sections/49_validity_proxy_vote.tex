\section{Validity of proxy vote}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A proxy who is not entitled to vote on a resolution as a member may vote as a proxy for another member who can vote if the appointment specifies the way the proxy is to vote on the resolution and the proxy votes that way.
    
    \item Unless the Company receives written notice of one of the following matters before the start or resumption of the meeting at which the proxy votes, a vote cast by the proxy will be valid even if:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item the appointing member dies;
        \item the member is mentally incapacitated;
        \item the member revokes the proxy's appointment;
        \item the member revokes the authority under which the proxy was appointed by a third party; or
        \item the member transfers the share in respect of which the proxy was given, before the proxy votes.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item A proxy is not revoked by the member attending and taking part in the meeting unless the member actually votes at the meeting on a resolution for which the proxy is proposed to be used.
\end{enumerate}
