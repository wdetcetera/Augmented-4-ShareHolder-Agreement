\section{Postponement of general meeting}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The directors may postpone the holding of any general meeting whenever they see fit (other than a meeting requisitioned by shareholders as provided by the Act) for not more than 42 days after the date for which it was originally called.
    
    \item Whenever any meeting is postponed (as distinct from being adjourned under rule 40.c) the same period of notice of the meeting must be given to persons entitled to receive notice of a meeting as if a new meeting were being called for the date to which the original meeting is postponed.
