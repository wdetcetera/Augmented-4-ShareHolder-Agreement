\section{Entitlement to share certificates}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A person whose name is entered as a member in the Register is entitled without payment to one certificate for the shares registered in the member's name or to several certificates in reasonable denominations.
    
    \item Where securities are held jointly by several persons the Company is not bound to issue more than one certificate.
    
    \item Delivery of a certificate of securities may be effected by delivering it personally to the holder or by posting it in a prepaid envelope addressed to the holder at the address shown in the Register or by delivering or posting the certificate in accordance with the written instructions of the holder. Delivery of a certificate to one of several joint holders is sufficient delivery to all of them.
    
    \item A certificate must state:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item the name of the Company and the fact that it is registered under the Act;
        \item the number of the certificate;
        \item the number and class of shares for which the certificate is issued; and
        \item the extent to which the shares are paid up.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Share certificates must clearly identify the specific share class (Ordinary Shares (Voting), Preference Shares (Non-Voting), or Employee Ordinary Shares (Non-Voting)) in accordance with the Shareholders Agreement.
