\section{Director voting on contract of indemnity or insurance}

Despite anything in this constitution, a director is not precluded from voting in respect of any contract or proposed contract of indemnity or insurance merely because the contract indemnifies or insures or would indemnify or insure the director against a liability incurred by the director as an officer of the Company or of a related body corporate.
