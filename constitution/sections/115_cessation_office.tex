\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The directors may:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item upon a director ceasing to hold office; or
        \item at any time after a director ceases to hold office, whether by retirement or otherwise,
    \end{enumerate}
    
    pay to the former director; or any of the legal personal representatives or dependants of the former director in the case of death, a lump sum in respect of past services of the director of an amount not exceeding the amount permitted by the Act, without recourse to a general meeting.
    
    \item A determination made by the directors in good faith that a person is or was at the time of the death of a director a dependant of the director is conclusive for all purposes of rule 115.a.
    
    \item Subject to the Act, the directors may determine that in addition to other remuneration paid or payable, the Company pay a former Director, or the personal representative, spouse, relative or dependant of a former Director, a retirement benefit or pension in recognition of past services of an amount determined by the directors or may make contributions to a superannuation, retirement or pension fund for that purpose (including any amount paid or payable for the avoidance or minimisation of any penalty, charge, tax or other impost on the Company under any applicable legislation which imposes a penalty, charge, tax or other impost on employers if a minimum level of superannuation contributions are not paid for an employee (within the meaning of the legislation)).
    
    \item The Company may contract with any director to secure payment of the lump sum to the director, his or her legal personal representatives or dependants or any of them, unless prohibited by the Act.
