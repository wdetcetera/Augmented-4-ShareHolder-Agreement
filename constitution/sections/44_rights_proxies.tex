\section{Rights of proxies}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A proxy appointed to attend and vote for a member has the same rights as the member:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item to speak at the meeting;
        \item to vote (but only to the extent allowed by the appointment); and
        \item to join in a demand for a poll.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item If a proxy is only for a single meeting it may be used at any postponement or adjournment of that meeting, unless the proxy states otherwise.
    
    \item A proxy's authority to speak and vote for a member at a meeting is suspended while the member is present at the meeting.
    
    \item A proxy may be revoked at any time by notice in writing to the Company.
