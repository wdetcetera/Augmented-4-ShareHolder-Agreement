\section{Circulating resolutions in directors' meetings}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The directors may pass a resolution without a directors' meeting being held if all the directors entitled to vote on the resolution (except a director absent from Australia who has not left a facsimile number or other contact details acceptable to the directors, at which he or she may be given notice) sign a document containing a statement that they are in favour of the resolution set out in the document.
    
    \item Separate copies of a document may be used for signing by directors if the wording of the resolution and statement is identical in each copy.
    
    \item The resolution is passed when the last director signs.
    
    \item A facsimile addressed to or received by the Company and purporting to be signed or sent by a director for the purpose of this rule 97 must be treated as a document in writing signed by that director.
    
    \item In this rule 97 a reference to all directors does not include a reference to an alternate director whose appointor has signed the document, but an alternate director may sign the document in the place of his or her appointor.
