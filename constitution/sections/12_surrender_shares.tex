\section{Surrender of shares}

The directors may accept the surrender of any paid up share by way of compromise of any question as to the holder being properly registered in respect of the share. Any share so surrendered may be disposed of in the same manner as a forfeited share.

\textbf{Note:} Any surrender of shares under this section must comply with the Shareholders Agreement, particularly the transfer restrictions and procedures applicable to each share class.
