\section{Circulating resolutions - more than one member}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item This rule 26 applies to resolutions which the Act, or this constitution, requires or permits to be passed at a general meeting, except a resolution under section 329 of the Act to remove an auditor.
    
    \item The Company may pass a resolution without a general meeting being held if all the members entitled to vote on the resolution sign a document containing a statement that they are in favour of the resolution set out in the document. If a share is held jointly, each of the joint members must sign.
    
    \item Separate copies of a document may be used for signing by members if the wording of the resolution and statement is identical in each copy.
    
    \item The resolution is passed when the last member signs.
    
    \item If the Company receives by facsimile transmission a copy of a document referred to in this rule 26 it is entitled to assume that the copy is a true copy.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note:} Circulating resolutions must comply with the Shareholders Agreement, particularly regarding Reserved Matters that require unanimous founder approval and any specific voting procedures for different share classes.
