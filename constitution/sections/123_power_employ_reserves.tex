\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The directors may, before recommending or deciding to pay any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the Company those sums they think proper as reserves, to be applied, at the discretion of the directors, for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied.
    
    \item Pending the application of reserves under rule 123.a, the reserves may, at the discretion of the directors, be used in the business of the Company or be invested as the directors see fit.
    
    \item The directors may carry forward so much of the profits remaining as they consider ought not to be distributed as dividends without transferring those profits to a reserve.
