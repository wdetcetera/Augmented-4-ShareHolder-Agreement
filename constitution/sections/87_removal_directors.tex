\section{Removal of directors}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item The Company may by resolution remove a director from office.
    
    \item Members holding shares which give them the right to a majority of votes at a general meeting may at any time by instrument in writing remove a director from office and appoint a person to be a director either in place of a director so removed or to fill a casual vacancy, or as an addition to the board of directors (but so that the total number of directors does not exceed the number fixed in accordance with this constitution).
    
    \item A removal or appointment under rule 87.b takes effect immediately on the delivery of the instrument of removal or appointment at the registered office of the Company. The instrument may be in separate parts each signed by one or more members.
