\section{Insufficient directors}

In the event of a vacancy in the office of a director, the remaining directors may act, but if the number of remaining directors is not sufficient to constitute a quorum at a meeting of directors, they may act only for the purpose of increasing the number of directors to a number sufficient to constitute a quorum or convening a general meeting of the Company.
