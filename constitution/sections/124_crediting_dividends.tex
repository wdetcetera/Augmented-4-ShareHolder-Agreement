\section{Crediting of dividends}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Subject to the rights of persons (if any) entitled to shares with special rights as to dividend and to this rule 124, all dividends are apportioned and paid equally on each share.
    
    \item If a share is issued on terms that it will rank for dividend as from a particular date, that share ranks for dividend only from that date.
    
    \item Despite any other provision of this rule 124, the holder of a partly paid share is not entitled to a greater proportion of the dividend than the proportion which the amount paid (not credited) is of the total amounts paid and payable (excluding amounts credited). In this rule 124.c amounts paid in advance of a call are ignored when calculating the proportion.
