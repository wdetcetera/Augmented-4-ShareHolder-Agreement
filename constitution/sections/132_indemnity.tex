\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item To the extent permitted by the Act, the Company indemnifies:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item every person who is or has been an officer of the Company; and
        \item where the board of directors considers it appropriate to do so, any person who is or has been an officer of a related body corporate of the Company,
    \end{enumerate}
    
    against all losses, liabilities, costs, charges and expenses incurred by that person in his or her capacity as an officer of the Company or of the related body corporate (as the case may be). This indemnity includes:
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
        \item a liability for negligence; and
        \item a liability for reasonable legal costs on a solicitor client basis including in respect of civil or criminal proceedings except to the extent prohibited by section 199A(3) of the Act.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item The indemnity does not extend to and is not an indemnity against any amount in respect of which the indemnity would otherwise be illegal, void or unenforceable or not permitted by law and does not operate in respect of any liability of the officer to the extent that liability is covered by insurance.
    
    \item In accordance with section 199A of the Act, the Company must not indemnify a person against:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item any of the following liabilities incurred as an officer of the Company:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item a liability owed to the Company or a related body corporate;
            \item a liability for a pecuniary penalty order under section 1317G of the Act or a compensation order under sections 961M, 1317H, 1317HA or 1317HB of the Act; or
            \item a liability that is owed to someone other than the Company or a related body corporate and did not arise out of conduct in good faith; or
        \end{enumerate}
        \item legal costs incurred in defending an action for a liability incurred as an officer of the Company if the costs are incurred:
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item in defending or resisting proceedings in which the person is found to have a liability for which they could not be indemnified under rule 132.c.i;
            \item in defending or resisting criminal proceedings in which the person is found guilty;
            \item in defending or resisting proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or a liquidator for a court order if the grounds for the court order are found by the court to have been established; or
            \item in connection with proceedings for relief to the person under the Act, in which the Court denies the relief.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Rule 132.c.ii.c does not apply to costs incurred in responding to actions taken by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or a liquidator as part of an investigation before commencing proceedings for a court order.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]

        \item For the purposes of rule 132.c.ii the outcome of proceedings is the outcome of the proceedings and any appeal in relation to the proceedings.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item An officer must:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item give notice to the Company promptly on becoming aware of any Claim against the officer that may give rise to a right to be indemnified by the Company;
        \item take such action as the Company reasonably requests to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal against, compromise or defend any Claim or any adjudication of a Claim;
        \item not make any admission of liability in respect of or settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Company;
        \item allow the Company or its insurers to assume the conduct, negotiation or defence of any Claim and, on request by the Company, render all reasonable assistance and cooperation to the Company or its insurers in the conduct of any Claim, including giving the Company or its insurers any document, authority or direction that the Company or its insurers may reasonably require for the prosecution or advancement of any counterclaim or crossclaim;
        \item on request by the Company or its insurers, do everything necessary or desirable which the Company reasonably requests to enable the Company or its insurers (so far as it is possible) to be subrogated to and enjoy the benefits of the officer's rights in relation to any counterclaim or crossclaim or any claims against any third party and render such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Company or its insurers for that purpose; and
        \item notify any Claim to an insurer or any other person who may be liable to indemnify the officer in respect of that Claim and promptly take all reasonable steps to enforce all the officer's rights against the insurer or other person.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item In rule 132.d Claim means:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item any writ, summons, crossclaim, counterclaim, application or other originating legal or arbitral process against an officer as an officer of the Company;
        \item any hearing, complaint, inquiry, investigation, proceeding or application commenced or originating against an officer as an officer of the Company; or
        \item any other proceeding, investigation, inquiry or hearing in which an officer is involved as an officer of the Company.
    \end{enumerate}
